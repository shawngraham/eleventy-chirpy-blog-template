## Syllabus Week by Week

Each week will open with twenty to thirty minutes of freewriting. Try to identify the things that perplexed you in the readings before you came to class, and that you would like to talk about now. Revisit what you wrote in previous classes to connect with what you're thinking now. These pieces of writing will be collected each week into a [digital garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history). At the end of this term we will use this writing in conjunction with an AI to examine what it is we, as a group, think about AI.

### Week 1 The Dream of AI

...and why LLM are models of culture and history first and foremost. You will come to class already having had a look at the readings. In this session I will introduce the main themes of the course, my expectations, we'll find out about your expectations, and we'll play with a simple language model and wonder: how can this represent intelligence? And if it _doesn't_, then what _does_ it represent?

#### Activities
- Intro activity: Have you used GPT or similar, and for what?
- Lecture/Discussion  
- Markov Chains (a nice explanation <a href="https://p-mckenzie.github.io/2020/11/03/markov-chains/">here</a>; don't worry about the code section). Let's [play](https://classson.github.io/markov/).
- Freewriting

### Week 2 Earlier Antecedents and A Digression into the Longer History of Representing Information as Bits

In this week, I want to talk about the longer history of encoding 'information' or 'knowledge' outside of human brains (and why information might not be the same as knowledge). This'll be a deep dive, back to the origins of writing, but will also include a whirlwind tour of the foundations of digital computing.

#### Activities
- Freewriting; plant in [our digital garden](https://4805-garden.netlify.app). I'll walk you through this.
- SG on information theory, Claude Shannon, Alan Turing, and a potted history of information from earliest times
- Discussion
- Nicholas Cardini: [AI Forecasting Challenge](https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/llm-forecast/)

### Week 3 Phase Transition, 2012 - 2022

Neural networks, transformers, and attention

### Week 4 The OpenAI Civil War of 4.20 pm November 17 2023 - 1.14 am November 22 2023

Competing philosophies, governance, capitalism, and the _imagined_ dangers of AI

Making sure we know who will present what in weeks 5 - 8.

### Week 5 Student Presentations 

General Theme: Deeper History of AI

### Week 6 Student Presentations

General Theme: Current **Real** Harms of AI

### Week 7 Student Presentations

General Theme: AI and Historians/Archaeologists

### Week 8 Student Presentations

General Theme: Current **useful** deployments of AI

### Week 9 Building an Image Recognition App

Wherein we will retrain CLIP

### Week 10 Building and Querying a Knowledge Graph

Wherein we'll use Ollama and Zephyr and Jupyter Notebooks

### Week 11 Building a Chat Bot with our own Knowledge Base

Wherein we'll use LLM and Datasette, and explore some of the problems of using LLMs for 'research' 

### Week 12 Building Something Else

No doubt by the time we get to Week 12, some other interesting use case will emerge and we'll figure out how to use it. Worse case scenario: We'll explore strategies to use LLM to improve our own writing. I _am_ curious to think about the use of AI and sensorial representations of the past.

## Part Two

We'll meet every other week in a workshop format. You will arrive in the first session having already built a few things. Over the holiday you should have been sketching out ideas about what you want to do.

### Meeting 1: What is an ethical and useful thing to do with AI in/for History?
This will be an unconference style workshop. You'll throw ideas on the board about what you want to do. There'll be plenty of work to go around; you'll figure out broadly a topic/approach you want to explore, and come together with other students who want to explore the same ideas. The desired outcome here is that three to five teams will emerge. Ideally each team should have someone on it who is game for getting into the digital weeds (ie, at least one of you should be prepared to do a bit of the 'coding', keeping in mind the things I will have been saying the entire time about what that actually _means_). You will leave the meeting fired up about what you want to understand. 

### Meeting 2: Backwards Design
In this meeting, you'll present mockups to the group of where you think you'll _end up_. But you will not present your _own_ work. Rather, you will have read another group's materials and your group will present those instead. You will present what you think the end result of their ideal project implementation will be: we start at the end, and then design backwards to figure out how to get there. Groups whose work is being presented will listen quietly and take notes. This exercise will reveal to you things that you may have missed because you are too close to your project. After the presentation, each group will identify the three main things they've learned from hearing others' interpretation of the work, and will lay out their initial ideas on how to address these.

Mockups can include visual layouts, research outlines, narrative prose, and much more besides. You are welcome to use AI tools to help you think these things through - a paradata document will include all prompts and models consulted.   

### Meeting 3: Work In Progress (mid term check in)
This meeting will involve each group giving a progress report on how their project is going. Each group should include a discussion of what's going well, what's a current issue that is being solved, new opportunities for the project they've identified, and any issues that present a serious problem to the work. The class as a whole will listen carefully, and suggest issues to think about or possible solutions.

### Meeting 4: Paradata In Progress
The paradata that documents the _process_ of the project as it currently stands should be made available to the group before we meet. In this meeting, other groups will try to replicate aspects of your project from the paradata, to see if there are any elements missing or not fully explicated. Paradata should also relate the process of doing whatever it is you're doing with broader discussions (literature) on historical method. You may use AI to reverse outline your work; but again any such use must detail the prompts, models, and iterations in the paradata (you can see things getting recursive quite quickly if you're not careful.) 

### Meeting 5 and 6
These two meetings, towards the end of the term, will be an opportunity for each group to show off their finished project. Presentations need to carefully situate the process of both _building_ the thing and what the thing _implies_ for the practice of history. 

### Meeting 7: The Writing Of The Book
This meeting will be a book sprint where we collate our materials into a handbook for historians, and publish online. All projects will also be made available through Github, with appropriate supporting materials. 

All materials are formally due on the last day of term.
