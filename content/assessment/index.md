There is any amount of scholarly literature on the fact that grading and grading practices have an impact on how students learn and how they view the materials they come into contact with. Alas, the system we are in requires a letter grade at the end of a course.

You are in your final year. I want this class to be an opportunity for you to swing for the bleachers, to try things out that you might otherwise be inhibited from doing for fear of the impact on your grades if it went wrong ([I have many thoughts on this matter, having written an entire book](https://digitalpressatund.files.wordpress.com/2019/12/failing_gloriously_final.pdf)).

**I value process over product**. This means, the process of learning (composed of experiences that sometimes work, experiences that sometimes don't) is what I'm after. You will notice that the things that you produce in this class are all evidence of your _learning process_. The assessed parts of this course depend on the following elements (notice that the majority of the focus is on things that might be categorized as 'processual'):

+ scholarly presence (part 1) 40%
	+ session leader 
	+ free writing 
	+ active engagement with discussions
	+ hands on exercises
+ project (part 2) 40%
	+ design document (part 2 meeting 2) 
	+ paradata in progress (part 2 meeting 4)
	+ showcase (part 2 end of term)
	+ grimoire (assembling your various projects/free writing into a coherent whole)
+ scholarly generosity (over full course) 20%

For 'Scholarly Presence' you and I will discuss this together to arrive at an appropriate grade. You will self-assess your contributions under 'scholarly presence' and indicate in a one-page note what you think is appropriate grade. Your note should open with one of these two lines:
- 'My presence has made meaningful contributions to this class'
- 'I have made meaningful contributions but there are reasons why I haven't made more'

I will take your self-assessment into consideration, and if I agree, then that will be your grade. When I have disagreed in the past with a self-assessment, nine times out of ten it has been because I have seen greater value in your contribution that you have.

For 'Scholarly Generosity', I will consult your peers on the ways you have been generous in your scholarly identity in our classroom, on a three point scale: 'excellent' | supportive' | 'developing', with examples. For more on such ['generous thinking', see Kathleen Fitzpatrick's introduction to her book of the same name](https://kfitz.info/generous-thinking-introduction/).
